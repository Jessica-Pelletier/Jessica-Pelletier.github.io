    <p>Impact Atlas is a WordPress-based concept prototype demonstrating how a specialized platform could document social impact initiatives globally. Designed with social entrepreneurs, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers in mind, this portfolio piece showcases technical implementation of a custom Bootstrap theme and an interactive Leaflet.js map allowing users to navigate initiatives by geographic location.
        The prototype distinguishes itself from traditional news sites by focusing on structured, actionable contentâ€”including mock case studies, methodologies, and replication guides. Articles follow a consistent format designed for information clarity with links to simulated research sources.
        Technical features include Relief Web API integration, custom WordPress theming, responsive design principles, and geospatial data visualization through Leaflet.js. This mockup effectively demonstrates the intersection of web development skills with content strategy, showing how specialized digital platforms can be designed to serve specific user needs in the social impact sector. </p>
